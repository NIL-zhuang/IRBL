Open the dialog
Clear the temporary dialog modal parent
This will not work on multiple screens or for printing Should use DC for the proper device
Feature in Windows If the lfHeight of the LOGFONT structure is positive the lfHeight measures the height of the entire cell including internal leading in logical units Since the height of a font in points does not include the internal leading we must subtract the internal leading which requires a TEXTMETRIC which in turn requires font creation
Compute the result
