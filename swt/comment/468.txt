These are the undocumented control id s for the children of a tab control Since there are no constants for these values they may change with different versions of Windows
Feature in Windows The tab control window class uses the CS HREDRAW and CS VREDRAW style bits to force a full redraw of the control and all children when resized This causes flashing The fix is to register a new window class without these bits and implement special code that damages only the exposed area NOTE Screen readers look for the exact class name of the control in order to provide the correct kind of assistance Therefore it is critical that the new window class have the same name It is possible to register a local window class with the same name as a global class Since bits that affect the class are being changed it is possible that other native code other than SWT could create a control with this class name and fail unexpectedly
Constructs a new instance of this class given its parent and a style value describing its behavior and appearance p The style value is either one of the style constants defined in class code SWT code which is applicable to instances of this class or must be built by em bitwise OR em ing together that is using the code int code operator two or more of those code SWT code style constants The class description lists the style constants that are applicable to the class Style bits are also inherited from superclasses p param parent a composite control which will be the parent of the new instance cannot be null param style the style of control to construct exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the parent is null li ul exception SWTException ul li ERROR THREAD INVALID ACCESS if not called from the thread that created the parent li li ERROR INVALID SUBCLASS if this class is not an allowed subclass li ul see SWT see Widget checkSubclass see Widget getStyle

Force tabs to be on the bottom for tab folders on PPC
Even though it is legal to create this widget with scroll bars they serve no useful purpose because they do not automatically scroll the widget s client area The fix is to clear the SWT style
Send a selection event when the item that is added becomes the new selection This only happens when the first item is added
COMCTL32 VERSION
Enable the flat look for tab folders on PPC
Feature in Windows Despite the fact that the tool tip text contains r n the tooltip will not honour the new line unless TTM SETMAXTIPWIDTH is set The fix is to set TTM SETMAXTIPWIDTH to a large value

Bug in Windows Under certain circumstances when TCM SETITEM is used to change the text in a tab item the tab folder draws on top of the client area The fix is ensure that this cannot happen by setting WS CLIPCHILDREN
Return DLGC BUTTON so that mnemonics will be processed without needing to press the ALT key when the widget has focus
Feature in Windows The tab control implements WM NCHITTEST to return HTCLIENT when the cursor is inside the tab buttons This causes mouse events like WM MOUSEMOVE to be delivered to the parent Also tool tips for the tab control are never invoked because tool tips rely on mouse events to be delivered to the window that wants to display the tool tip The fix is to call the default window proc that returns HTCLIENT when the mouse is in the client area
Feature in Windows When the tab folder window proc processes WM NOTIFY it forwards this message to its parent This is done so that children of this control that send this message type to their parent will notify not only this control but also the parent of this control which is typically the application window and the window that is looking for the message If the control did not forward the message applications would have to subclass the control window to see the message Because the control window is subclassed by SWT the message is delivered twice once by SWT and once when the message is forwarded by the window proc The fix is to avoid calling the window proc for this control
Feature in Windows Windows does not explicitly set the orientation of the buddy control Instead the orientation is inherited when WS EX LAYOUTRTL is specified for the tab folder This means that when both WS EX LAYOUTRTL and WS EX NOINHERITLAYOUT are specified for the tab folder the buddy control will not be oriented correctly The fix is to explicitly set the orientation for the buddy control NOTE WS EX LAYOUTRTL is not supported on Windows NT
It is possible but unlikely that application code could have disposed the widget in the resize event If this happens end the processing of the Windows message by returning the result of the WM SIZE message
