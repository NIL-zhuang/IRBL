Answer a palette containing numGrays shades of gray ranging from black to white
NON NLS 1
NON NLS 1
aspect block 6 0xFF
sorted false
sorted bitField 0x8 0
Read the 0 byte terminator at the end of the image
We read the terminator earlier
Load the GIF image s stored in the input stream Return an array of ImageData representing the image s
Read and return the next block or extension identifier from the file
Read extensions until an image descriptor appears In the future if we care about the extensions they should be properly grouped with the image data before which they appeared Right now the interesting parts of some extensions are kept but the rest is discarded Throw an error if an error occurs
the block contents
Read a control extension Return the extension block data
We have just read the Comment extension identifier from the input stream Read in the rest of the comment and return it GIF comment blocks are variable size
Read size of block 0x0C
Read the text information x y width height colors
Read the text
We have just read the PlainText extension identifier from the input stream Read in the plain text info and text and return the text GIF plain text blocks are variable size
Read size of block 0x04
Read the control block
Store the disposal method
Store the delay time
Work around a customer has a GIF that specifies an invalid color index that is larger than the number of entries in the palette Detect this case and ignore the specified color index
Store the transparent color
Read block terminator
We have just read the GraphicsControl extension identifier from the input stream Read in the control information store it and return it
Read size of block 0x0B
Read application identifier
Read authentication code
Read application data
NON NLS 1 NON NLS 2
Look for the NETSCAPE repeat count field for an animated GIF
We have just read the Application extension identifier from the input stream Read in the rest of the extension look for and store number of repeats and return the data
No local palette
Local palette
boolean sorted bitField 0x20 0
Promote depth to next highest supported value
Return a DeviceIndependentImage representing the image block at the current position in the input stream Throw an error if an error occurs
Read a palette from the input stream
Write the specified device independent image to the output stream
size of block
block terminator
Write out a GraphicsControlBlock to describe the specified device independent image
no interlace no sort no local palette
Write the specified device independent image to the current position in the output stream
Write the specified palette to the output stream
