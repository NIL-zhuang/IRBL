code GridData code is the layout data object associated with code GridLayout code To set a code GridData code object into a control you use the code Control setLayoutData Object code method p There are two ways to create a code GridData code object with certain fields set The first is to set the fields directly like this pre GridData gridData new GridData gridData horizontalAlignment GridData FILL gridData grabExcessHorizontalSpace true button1 setLayoutData gridData pre The second is to take advantage of convenience style bits defined by code GridData code pre button1 setLayoutData new GridData GridData HORIZONTAL ALIGN FILL GridData GRAB HORIZONTAL pre p p NOTE Do not reuse code GridData code objects Every control in a code Composite code that is managed by a code GridLayout code must have a unique code GridData code object If the layout data for a control in a code GridLayout code is null at layout time a unique code GridData code object is created for it p see GridLayout see Control setLayoutData
verticalAlignment specifies how controls will be positioned vertically within a cell The default value is CENTER Possible values are ul li SWT BEGINNING or SWT TOP Position the control at the top of the cell li li SWT CENTER Position the control in the vertical center of the cell li li SWT END or SWT BOTTOM Position the control at the bottom of the cell li li SWT FILL Resize the control to fill the cell vertically li ul
horizontalAlignment specifies how controls will be positioned horizontally within a cell The default value is BEGINNING Possible values are ul li SWT BEGINNING or SWT LEFT Position the control at the left of the cell li li SWT CENTER Position the control in the horizontal center of the cell li li SWT END or SWT RIGHT Position the control at the right of the cell li li SWT FILL Resize the control to fill the cell horizontally li ul
widthHint specifies the preferred width in pixels This value is the wHint passed into Control computeSize int int boolean to determine the preferred size of the control The default value is SWT DEFAULT see Control computeSize int int boolean
heightHint specifies the preferred height in pixels This value is the hHint passed into Control computeSize int int boolean to determine the preferred size of the control The default value is SWT DEFAULT see Control computeSize int int boolean
horizontalIndent specifies the number of pixels of indentation that will be placed along the left side of the cell The default value is 0
verticalIndent specifies the number of pixels of indentation that will be placed along the top side of the cell The default value is 0 since 3 1
horizontalSpan specifies the number of column cells that the control will take up The default value is 1
verticalSpan specifies the number of row cells that the control will take up The default value is 1
p grabExcessHorizontalSpace specifies whether the width of the cell changes depending on the size of the parent Composite If grabExcessHorizontalSpace is code true code the following rules apply to the width of the cell p ul li If extra horizontal space is available in the parent the cell will grow to be wider than its preferred width The new width will be preferred width delta where delta is the extra horizontal space divided by the number of grabbing columns li li If there is not enough horizontal space available in the parent the cell will shrink until it reaches its minimum width as specified by GridData minimumWidth The new width will be the maximum of minimumWidth and preferred width delta where delta is the amount of space missing divided by the number of grabbing columns li li If the parent is packed the cell will be its preferred width as specified by GridData widthHint li li If the control spans multiple columns and there are no other grabbing controls in any of the spanned columns the last column in the span will grab the extra space If there is at least one other grabbing control in the span the grabbing will be spread over the columns already marked as grabExcessHorizontalSpace li ul p The default value is false p see GridData minimumWidth see GridData widthHint
p grabExcessVerticalSpace specifies whether the height of the cell changes depending on the size of the parent Composite If grabExcessVerticalSpace is code true code the following rules apply to the height of the cell p ul li If extra vertical space is available in the parent the cell will grow to be taller than its preferred height The new height will be preferred height delta where delta is the extra vertical space divided by the number of grabbing rows li li If there is not enough vertical space available in the parent the cell will shrink until it reaches its minimum height as specified by GridData minimumHeight The new height will be the maximum of minimumHeight and preferred height delta where delta is the amount of space missing divided by the number of grabbing rows li li If the parent is packed the cell will be its preferred height as specified by GridData heightHint li li If the control spans multiple rows and there are no other grabbing controls in any of the spanned rows the last row in the span will grab the extra space If there is at least one other grabbing control in the span the grabbing will be spread over the rows already marked as grabExcessVerticalSpace li ul p The default value is false p see GridData minimumHeight see GridData heightHint
minimumWidth specifies the minimum width in pixels This value applies only if grabExcessHorizontalSpace is true A value of SWT DEFAULT means that the minimum width will be the result of Control computeSize int int boolean where wHint is determined by GridData widthHint The default value is 0 since 3 1 see Control computeSize int int boolean see GridData widthHint
minimumHeight specifies the minimum height in pixels This value applies only if grabExcessVerticalSpace is true A value of SWT DEFAULT means that the minimum height will be the result of Control computeSize int int boolean where hHint is determined by GridData heightHint The default value is 0 since 3 1 see Control computeSize int int boolean see GridData heightHint
exclude informs the layout to ignore this control when sizing and positioning controls If this value is code true code the size and position of the control will not be managed by the layout If this value is code false code the size and position of the control will be computed and assigned The default value is code false code since 3 1
Value for horizontalAlignment or verticalAlignment Position the control at the top or left of the cell Not recommended Use SWT BEGINNING SWT TOP or SWT LEFT instead
Value for horizontalAlignment or verticalAlignment Position the control in the vertical or horizontal center of the cell Not recommended Use SWT CENTER instead
Value for horizontalAlignment or verticalAlignment Position the control at the bottom or right of the cell Not recommended Use SWT END SWT BOTTOM or SWT RIGHT instead
Value for horizontalAlignment or verticalAlignment Resize the control to fill the cell horizontally or vertically Not recommended Use SWT FILL instead
