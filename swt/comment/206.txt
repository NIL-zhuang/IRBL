PEGHuffmanTable class actually represents two types of object 1 A DHT Define Huffman Tables segment which may represent as many as 4 Huffman tables In this case the tables are stored in the allTables array 2 A single Huffman table In this case the allTables array will be null The reference field is stored in both types of object but initialize is only called if the object represents a DHT
maximum is 4 AC 4 DC
table class AC 1 or DC 0
table id 0 1 baseline 0 3 prog ext
Read the 16 count bytes and add them together to get the table size
Read the table
start with 50 and increment as needed
Truncate huffCodeLengths to the correct size
start with 50 and increment as needed
Truncate huffCodes to the correct size
Calculate the maximum and minimum codes
Calculate the eHuffman codes and lengths
Create the new PEGHuffmanTable and add it to the allTables array
