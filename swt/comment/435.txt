When the WM COMMAND message is sent from a menu the HWND parameter in LPARAM is zero

It is possible but unlikely that application code could have disposed the widget in the hide event If this happens stop searching up the ancestor list because there is no longer a link to follow
The shell and the new menu may be disposed because of sending the hide event to the ancestor menus but setting a field to null in a disposed shell is not harmful
Send the show event
Feature in Windows When the user types Alt key and key does not match a mnemonic in the System menu or the menu bar Windows beeps This beep is unexpected and unwanted by applications that look for Alt key The fix is to detect the case and stop Windows from beeping by closing the menu
When the user cancels any menu that is not the menu bar assume a mnemonic key was pressed to open the menu from WM SYSCHAR When the menu was invoked using the mouse this assumption is wrong but not harmful This variable is only used in WM SYSCHAR and WM SYSCHAR is only sent after the user has pressed a mnemonic
It is possible but unlikely that application code could have disposed the widget in the hide event If this happens stop searching up the parent list because there is no longer a link to follow
The shell may be disposed because of sending the hide event to the last active menu menu but setting a field to null in a destroyed widget is not harmful
It is possible but unlikely that application code could have disposed the widget in the hide event or the item about to be armed If this happens stop searching up the ancestor list because there is no longer a link to follow
The shell and or the item could be disposed when processing hide events from above If this happens ensure that the shell is not accessed and that no arm event is sent to the item
widget could be disposed at this point
widget could be disposed at this point
Check to see if the command is a system command or a user menu item that was added to the System menu When a user item is added to the System menu WM SYSCOMMAND must always return zero
Process the System Command
When lParam is not zero Alt key was pressed If the application is interested in keystrokes and there is a menu bar check to see whether the key that was pressed matches a mnemonic on the menu bar Normally Windows matches the first character of a menu item as well as matching the mnemonic character To allow the application to see the keystrokes in this case avoid running the default window proc NOTE When the user types Alt Space the System menu is activated In this case the application should not see the keystroke
When lParam is zero one of F10 Shift F10 Ctrl F10 or Ctrl Shift F10 was pressed If there is no menu bar and the focus control is interested in keystrokes give the key to the focus control Normally F10 with no menu bar moves focus to the System menu but this can be achieved using Alt Space To allow the application to see F10 avoid running the default window proc NOTE When F10 is pressed WM SYSCOMMAND is sent to the shell not the focus control This is undocumented Windows behavior
FALL THROUGH
Do not allow keyboard traversal of the menu bar or scrolling when the shell is not enabled
Save the focus widget when the shell is minimized
Bug in Windows When WM SETREDRAW is used to turn off drawing for a control and the control is moved or resized Windows does not redraw the area where the control once was in the parent The fix is to detect this case and redraw the area
