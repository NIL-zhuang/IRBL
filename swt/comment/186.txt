This class is a placeholder for utility methods commonly used on 2SE platforms but not supported on some 2ME profiles p It is part of our effort to provide support for both 2SE and 2ME platforms p p IMPORTANT some of the methods have been modified from their 2SE parents Refer to the description of each method for specific changes p ul li Exceptions thrown may differ since 2ME s set of exceptions is a subset of 2SE s one li li The range of the mathematic functions is subject to change li ul
