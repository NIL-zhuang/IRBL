the x coordinate of the rectangle
the y coordinate of the rectangle
the width of the rectangle
the height of the rectangle
Construct a new instance of this class given the x y width and height values param x the x coordinate of the origin of the rectangle param y the y coordinate of the origin of the rectangle param width the width of the rectangle param height the height of the rectangle
Destructively replaces the x y width and height values in the receiver with ones which represent the union of the rectangles specified by the receiver and the given rectangle p The union of two rectangles is the smallest single rectangle that completely covers both of the areas covered by the two given rectangles p param rect the rectangle to merge with the receiver exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul
Returns code true code if the point specified by the arguments is inside the area specified by the receiver and code false code otherwise param x the x coordinate of the point to test for containment param y the y coordinate of the point to test for containment return code true code if the rectangle contains the point and code false code otherwise
Returns code true code if the given point is inside the area specified by the receiver and code false code otherwise param pt the point to test for containment return code true code if the rectangle contains the point and code false code otherwise exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul
Compares the argument to the receiver and returns true if they represent the em same em object using a class specific comparison param object the object to compare with this object return code true code if the object is the same as this object and code false code otherwise see hashCode
Returns an integer hash code for the receiver Any two objects that return code true code when passed to code equals code must return the same value for this method return the receiver s hash see equals Object
Destructively replaces the x y width and height values in the receiver with ones which represent the intersection of the rectangles specified by the receiver and the given rectangle param rect the rectangle to intersect with the receiver exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul since 3 0
Returns a new rectangle which represents the intersection of the receiver and the given rectangle p The intersection of two rectangles is the rectangle that covers the area which is contained within both rectangles p param rect the rectangle to intersect with the receiver return the intersection of the receiver and the argument exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul
Returns code true code if the rectangle described by the arguments intersects with the receiver and code false code otherwise p Two rectangles intersect if the area of the rectangle representing their intersection is not empty p param x the x coordinate of the origin of the rectangle param y the y coordinate of the origin of the rectangle param width the width of the rectangle param height the height of the rectangle return code true code if the rectangle intersects with the receiver and code false code otherwise exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul see intersection Rectangle see isEmpty since 3 0
Returns code true code if the given rectangle intersects with the receiver and code false code otherwise p Two rectangles intersect if the area of the rectangle representing their intersection is not empty p param rect the rectangle to test for intersection return code true code if the rectangle intersects with the receiver and code false code otherwise exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul see intersection Rectangle see isEmpty
Returns code true code if the receiver does not cover any area in the x y coordinate plane and code false code if the receiver does cover some area in the plane p A rectangle is considered to em cover area em in the x y coordinate plane if both its width and height are non zero p return code true code if the receiver is empty and code false code otherwise

Returns a string containing a concise human readable description of the receiver return a string representation of the rectangle
Returns a new rectangle which represents the union of the receiver and the given rectangle p The union of two rectangles is the smallest single rectangle that completely covers both of the areas covered by the two given rectangles p param rect the rectangle to perform union with return the union of the receiver and the argument exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the argument is null li ul see add Rectangle
