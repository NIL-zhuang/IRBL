Drag and Drop Operation a copy of the data is added to the drop target and the original data is removed from the drag source value is 1 lt lt 1
Drag and Drop Operation the drop target makes a link to the data in the drag source value is 1 lt lt 2
Drag and Drop Operation the drop target moves the data and the drag source removes any references to the data and updates its display This is not available on all platforms and is only used when a non SWT application is the drop target In this case the SWT drag source is informed in the dragFinished event that the drop target has moved the data value is 1 lt lt 3 see DragSourceListener dragFinished
Drag and Drop Operation During a dragEnter event or a dragOperationChanged if no modifier keys are pressed the operation is set to DROP DEFAULT The application can choose what the default operation should be by setting a new value in the operation field If no value is choosen the default operation for the platform will be selected value is 1 lt lt 4 see DropTargetListener dragEnter see DropTargetListener dragOperationChanged since 2 0
DragSource Event the drop has successfully completed or has been terminated such as hitting the ESC key perform cleanup such as removing data on a move operation value is 2000
DragSource Event the data to be dropped is required from the drag source value is 2001
DropTarget Event the cursor has entered the drop target boundaries value is 2002
DropTarget Event the cursor has left the drop target boundaries OR the drop operation has been cancelled such as by hitting ECS OR the drop is about to happen user has released the mous ebutotn over this target value is 2003
DropTarget Event the cursor is over the drop target value is 2004
DropTarget Event the operation being performed has changed usually due to the user changing the selected modifier keys while dragging value is 2005
DropTarget Event the data has been dropped value is 2006
DropTarget Event the drop target is given a last chance to modify the drop value is 2007
DragSource Event a drag is about to begin value is 2008
DropTarget drag under effect No effect is shown value is 0

DropTarget drag under effect An insertion mark is shown before the item under the cursor applies to trees value is 2
DropTarget drag under effect An insertion mark is shown after the item under the cursor applies to trees value is 4
DropTarget drag under effect The widget is scrolled up or down to allow the user to drop on items that are not currently visible applies to tables and trees value is 8
DropTarget drag under effect The item currently under the cursor is expanded to allow the user to select a drop target from a sub item applies to trees value is 16

Unknown Undefined Error
Throws an appropriate exception based on the passed in error code The code hresult code argument should be either 0 or the platform specific error code p In DND errors are reported by throwing one of three exceptions dl dd java lang IllegalArgumentException dd dt thrown whenever one of the API methods is invoked with an illegal argument dt dd org eclipse swt SWTException extends java lang RuntimeException dd dt thrown whenever a recoverable error happens internally in SWT dt dd org eclipse swt SWTError extends java lang Error dd dt thrown whenever a b non recoverable b error happens internally in SWT dt dl This method provides the logic which maps between error codes and one of the above exceptions p param code the DND error code param hresult the platform specific error code see SWTError see SWTException see IllegalArgumentException
