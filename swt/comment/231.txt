Different compression schemes
Noop when n 128
Copy next byte n 1 times
Copy next n 1 bytes literally
Number of bytes copied
PackBits decoder
Each row is byte aligned
Read a strip
R G B entries are 16 bit wide 2 bytes
SWT does not support 16 bit depth color formats Convert the 16 bit data to 8 bit data The correct way to do this is to multiply each 16 bit value by the value 2 8 1 2 16 1 The fast way to do this is just to drop the low byte of the 16 bit value
Calculate the nbr of required strips given the following requirements each strip should if possible not be greater than maxStripByteSize each strip should contain 1 or more entire rows Format the strip fields arrays so that the image data is stored in one contiguous block This block is stored after the IFD and after any tag info described in the IFD
Each strip contains 1 row
Nbr of bytes between the end of the IFD directory and the start of the image data Keep space for at least the offsets and counts data each field being TYPE LONG 4 bytes If other tags require space between the IFD and the image block use the extraBytes parameter If there is only one strip the offsets and counts data is stored directly in the IFD and we need not reserve space for it
Store all strips sequentially to allow us to copy all pixels in one contiguous area
The last strip may contain fewer rows
In a TIFF ColorMap all red come first followed by green and blue All values must be converted from 8 bit to 16 bit
Only the basic 1 and 3 values are supported
Ignored

2 dimensional coding is not supported

Get the offset of the colorMap use TYPE LONG
Set TIFF default values
Bilevel or Grayscale image
RGB image
SamplesPerPixel 3 is the only value supported
Palette Color image
Invalid type
Offset following the header and the directory
Extra space used by XResolution and YResolution values
The number of entries of the Color Map must match the bitsPerSample field
Extra space used by ColorMap values
Extra space used by BitsPerSample values
TIFF recommends storing the data in strips of no more than 8 Ko
TIFF header
Image File Directory
Offset of next IFD 0 for last IFD
BitsPerSample 8 8 8
XResolution and YResolution set to 300 dpi

little endian
TIFF identifier
Offset of the first IFD is chosen to be 8 It is word aligned and immediately after this header
Scanline pad must be 1
Palette must be black and white or white and black
0 means a color index of 0 is imaged as white
