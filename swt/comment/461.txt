Feature in Windows The track bar window class does not include CS DBLCLKS This mean that these controls will not get double click messages such as WM LBUTTONDBLCLK The fix is to register a new window class with CS DBLCLKS NOTE Screen readers look for the exact class name of the control in order to provide the correct kind of assistance Therefore it is critical that the new window class have the same name It is possible to register a local window class with the same name as a global class Since bits that affect the class are being changed it is possible that other native code other than SWT could create a control with this class name and fail unexpectedly

Bug in Windows Changing the background color of the Scale widget and calling InvalidateRect still draws with the old color The fix is to post a fake WM SETFOCUS event to cause it to redraw with the new background color Note This WM SETFOCUS message causes recursion when setBackground is called from within the focus event listener

Do nothing when scrolling is ending
Send the event because WM HSCROLL and WM VSCROLL are sent from a modal message loop in windows that is active when the user is scrolling
widget could be disposed at this point
