The class code FileTransfer code provides a platform specific mechanism for converting a list of files represented as a java code String code to a platform specific representation of the data and vice versa Each code String code in the array contains the absolute path for a single file or directory See code Transfer code for additional information p An example of a java code String code containing a list of files is shown below p code pre File file1 new File C temp file1 File file2 new File C temp file2 String fileData new String 2 fileData 0 file1 getAbsolutePath fileData 1 file2 getAbsolutePath code pre

Returns the singleton instance of the FileTransfer class return the singleton instance of the FileTransfer class
each name is null terminated
there is an extra null terminator at the very end
The caller of this method must release the data when it is done with it
This implementation of code javaToNative code converts a list of file names represented by a java code String code to a platform specific representation Each code String code in the array contains the absolute path for a single file or directory For additional information see code Transfer javaToNative code param object a java code String code containing the file names to be converted param transferData an empty code TransferData code object this object will be filled in on return with the platform specific format of the data
get file names from IDataObject
How many files are there
How long is the name
Get file name and append it to string
frees data associated with HDROP data
This implementation of code nativeToJava code converts a platform specific representation of a list of file names to a java code String code Each String in the array contains the absolute path for a single file or directory For additional information see code Transfer nativeToJava code param transferData the platform specific representation of the data to be been converted return a java code String code containing a list of file names if the conversion was successful otherwise null
