BMP RLE8 COMPRESSION
BMP RLE4 COMPRESSION
Compress numBytes bytes of image data from src storing in dest starting at 0 using the technique specified by comp If last is true this indicates the last line of the image Answer the size of the compressed data
find two consecutive bytes that are the same in the next 128
if there is only one more byte in the scan line include it
store the intervening data
handled separately because 0 2 is a command
1 byte 2 pixels
n bytes n 2 pixels
pad to word
find the length of the next run up to 127 and store it
n bytes n 2 pixels
store the end of line or end of bitmap codes
find two consecutive bytes that are the same in the next 256
if there is only one more byte in the scan line include it
store the intervening data
handled separately because 0 2 is a command
don t break fall through
handled separately because 0 1 is a command
pad to word
find the length of the next run up to 255 and store it
store the end of line or end of bitmap codes

Seek to the specified offset
Answer a byte array containing the BMP representation of the given device independent palette
BMP pads scanlines to multiples of 4 bytes
Compression can actually take twice as much space in worst case
Start at last line
Unload the given image s data into the given byte stream using the given compression strategy Answer the number of bytes written
BMP pads scanlines to multiples of 4 bytes
Start at last line
Prepare the given image s data for unloading into a byte stream using no compression strategy Answer the number of bytes written
Fill in file header except for bfsize which is done later
