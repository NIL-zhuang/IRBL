Returns the receiver s image data This is the icon that is associated with the reciever in the operating system return the image data for the program may be null
Returns the receiver s name This is as short and descriptive a name as possible for the program If the program has no descriptive name this string may be the executable name path or empty return the name of the program
Compares the argument to the receiver and returns true if they represent the em same em object using a class specific comparison param other the object to compare with this object return code true code if the object is the same as this object and code false code otherwise see hashCode
Returns an integer hash code for the receiver Any two objects that return code true code when passed to code equals code must return the same value for this method return the receiver s hash see equals Object

Returns a string containing a concise human readable description of the receiver return a string representation of the event
