This class is the abstract superclass of all device objects such as the Display device and the Printer device Devices can have a graphics context GC created for them and they can be drawn on by sending messages to the associated GC

TEMPORARY CODE When a graphics object is created and the device parameter is null the current Display is used This presents a problem because SWT graphics does not reference classes in SWT widgets The correct fix is to remove this feature Unfortunately too many application programs rely on this feature This code will be removed in the future

Creates the device in the operating system If the device does not have a handle this method may do nothing depending on the device p This method is called before code init code p p Subclasses are supposed to reimplement this method and not call the code super code implementation p param data the DeviceData which describes the receiver see init
Feature in Windows If the lfHeight of the LOGFONT structure is positive the lfHeight measures the height of the entire cell including internal leading in logical units Since the height of a font in points does not include the internal leading we must subtract the internal leading which requires a TEXTMETRIC
Destroys the device in the operating system and releases the device s handle If the device does not have a handle this method may do nothing depending on the device p This method is called after code release code p p Subclasses are supposed to reimplement this method and not call the code super code implementation p see dispose see release
Disposes of the operating system resources associated with the receiver After this method has been invoked the receiver will answer code true code when sent the message code isDisposed code see release see destroy see checkDevice

Feature in Windows If the lfHeight of the LOGFONT structure is positive the lfHeight measures the height of the entire cell including internal leading in logical units Since the height of a font in points does not include the internal leading we must subtract the internal leading which requires a TEXTMETRIC which in turn requires font creation

Bug in Windows 98 When EnumFontFamiliesEx is called with a specified face name it should enumerate for each available style of that font Instead it only enumerates once The fix is to call EnumFontFamilies which works as expected
The user did not specify a face name so they want all versions of all available face names
For bitmapped fonts EnumFontFamilies only enumerates once for each font regardless of how many styles are available If the user wants bitmapped fonts enumerate on each face name now

Returns the matching standard color for the given constant which should be one of the color constants specified in class code SWT code Any value other than one of the SWT color constants which is passed in will result in the color black This color should not be freed because it was allocated by the system not the application param id the color constant return the matching color exception SWTException ul li ERROR DEVICE DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul see SWT
Returns a reasonable font for applications to use On some platforms this will match the default font or system font if such can be found This font should not be freed because it was allocated by the system not the application p Typically applications which want the default look should simply not set the font on the widgets they create Widgets are always created with the correct default font for the class of user interface component they represent p return a font exception SWTException ul li ERROR DEVICE DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul
Returns code true code if the underlying window system prints out warning messages on the console and code setWarnings code had previously been called with code true code return code true code if warnings are being handled and code false code otherwise exception SWTException ul li ERROR DEVICE DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul

Feature on WinCE For some reason certain 8 bit WinCE devices return 0 for the number of reserved entries in the system palette Their system palette correctly contains the usual 20 system colors The workaround is to assume there are 20 reserved system colors instead of 0
Create the palette and reference counter
4 bytes header 4 bytes per entry numEntries entries
2 bytes special header
2 bytes number of colors LSB first
Create a palette which contains the system entries as they are located in the system palette The MSDN article Memory Device Contexts describes where system entries are located On an 8 bit display with 20 reserved colors the system colors will be the first 10 entries and the last 10 ones
Copy all entries from the system palette
Lock the indices corresponding to the system entries

Returns code true code if the device has been disposed and code false code otherwise p This method gets the dispose state for the device When a device has been disposed it is an error to invoke any other method using the device return code true code when the device is disposed and code false code otherwise
Releases any internal resources back to the operating system and clears all fields except the device handle p When a device is destroyed resources that were acquired on behalf of the programmer need to be returned to the operating system For example if the device allocated a font to be used as the system font this font would be freed in code release code Also to assist the garbage collector and minimize the amount of memory that is not reclaimed when the programmer keeps a reference to a disposed device all fields except the handle are zero d The handle is needed by code destroy code p This method is called before code destroy code p p If subclasses reimplement this method they must call the code super code implementation p see dispose see destroy
