Sets the number of decimal places used by the receiver p The digit setting is used to allow for floating point values in the receiver For example to set the selection to a floating point value of 1 37 call setDigits with a value of 2 and setSelection with a value of 137 Similarly if getDigits has a value of 2 and getSelection returns 137 this should be interpreted as 1 37 This applies to all numeric APIs param value the new digits must be greater than or equal to zero exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if the value is less than zero li ul exception SWTException ul li ERROR WIDGET DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li li ERROR THREAD INVALID ACCESS if not called from the thread that created the receiver li ul

Feature in Windows For some reason when the widget is a single line text widget when the user presses tab return or escape Windows beeps The fix is to look for these keys and not call the window proc
FALL THROUGH
if hooks SWT Verify filters SWT Verify return null
Increment the value
Stop the edit control from moving the caret
The SWT Modify event is sent after the widget has been updated with the new state Rather than allowing the default updown window proc to set the value when the user clicks on the updown control set the value explicity and stop the window proc from running
