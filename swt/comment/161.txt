Compares the argument to the receiver and returns true if they represent the em same em object using a class specific comparison param object the object to compare with this object return code true code if the object is the same as this object and code false code otherwise see hashCode
Get the locale ID
Check the language
Check the country
Get the charset
Returns the height of the receiver in points return the height of this FontData see setHeight
Returns the locale of the receiver p The locale determines which platform character set this font is going to use Widgets and graphics operations that use this font will convert UNICODE strings to the platform character set of the specified locale p p On platforms where there are multiple character sets for a given language country locale the variant portion of the locale will determine the character set p return the code String code representing a Locale object since 3 0
Returns the name of the receiver On platforms that support font foundries the return value will be the foundry followed by a dash followed by the face name return the name of this code FontData code see setName
Returns the style of the receiver which is a bitwise OR of one or more of the code SWT code constants NORMAL BOLD and ITALIC return the style of this code FontData code see setStyle
Returns an integer hash code for the receiver Any two objects that return code true code when passed to code equals code must return the same value for this method return the receiver s hash see equals
Sets the height of the receiver The parameter is specified in terms of points where a point is one seventy second of an inch param height the height of the code FontData code exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if the height is negative li ul see getHeight
