Feature in Windows The group box window class uses the CS HREDRAW and CS VREDRAW style bits to force a full redraw of the control and all children when resized This causes flashing The fix is to register a new window class without these bits and implement special code that damages only the exposed area Feature in WinCE On certain devices defining a new window class which looks like BUTTON causes CreateWindowEx to crash The workaround is to use the class Button directly

Bug in Windows When GetDCEx is called with DCX INTERSECTUPDATE the HDC that is returned does not include the current update region This was confirmed under DEBUG Windows when GetDCEx complained about invalid flags Therefore it is not easily possible to get an HDC from outside of WM PAINT that includes the current damage and clips children Because the receiver has children and draws a frame and label it is necessary that the receiver always draw clipped in the current damaged area The fix is to force the receiver to be fully clipped by including WS CLIPCHILDREN and WS CLIPSIBLINGS in the default style bits

Feature in Windows In version 6 00 of COMCTL32 DLL when WM PRINTCLIENT is sent from a child BS GROUP control to a parent BS GROUP the parent BS GROUP clears the font from the HDC Normally group boxes in Windows do not have children so this behavior is undefined When the parent of a BS GROUP is not a BS GROUP there is no problem The fix is to save and restore the current font
