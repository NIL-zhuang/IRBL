Feature in Windows The progress bar window class does not include CS DBLCLKS This mean that these controls will not get double click messages such as WM LBUTTONDBLCLK The fix is to register a new window class with CS DBLCLKS NOTE Screen readers look for the exact class name of the control in order to provide the correct kind of assistance Therefore it is critical that the new window class have the same name It is possible to register a local window class with the same name as a global class Since bits that affect the class are being changed it is possible that other native code other than SWT could create a control with this class name and fail unexpectedly

Sets the maximum value that the receiver will allow This new value will be ignored if it is not greater than the receiver s current minimum value If the new maximum is applied then the receiver s selection value will be adjusted if necessary to fall within its new range param value the new maximum which must be greater than the current minimum exception SWTException ul li ERROR WIDGET DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li li ERROR THREAD INVALID ACCESS if not called from the thread that created the receiver li ul
Sets the minimum value that the receiver will allow This new value will be ignored if it is negative or is not less than the receiver s current maximum value If the new minimum is applied then the receiver s selection value will be adjusted if necessary to fall within its new range param value the new minimum which must be nonnegative and less than the current maximum exception SWTException ul li ERROR WIDGET DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li li ERROR THREAD INVALID ACCESS if not called from the thread that created the receiver li ul

Feature in Windows The progress bar does not implement WM GETDLGCODE As a result a progress bar takes focus and takes part in tab traversal This behavior while unspecified is unwanted The fix is to implement WM GETDLGCODE to behave like a STATIC control
Feature in Windows When a progress bar with the style PBS MARQUEE becomes too small the animation currently a small bar moving from right to left does not have enough space to draw The result is that the progress bar does not appear to be moving The fix is to detect this case clear the PBS MARQUEE style and emulate the animation using PBM STEPIT NOTE This only happens on Window XP
