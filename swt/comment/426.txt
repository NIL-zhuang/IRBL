Instances of this class are used to print to a printer Applications create a GC on a printer using code new GC printer code and then draw on the printer GC using the usual graphics calls p A code Printer code object may be constructed by providing a code PrinterData code object which identifies the printer A code PrintDialog code presents a print dialog to the user and returns an initialized instance of code PrinterData code Alternatively calling code new Printer code will construct a printer object for the user s default printer p p Application code must explicitly invoke the code Printer dispose code method to release the operating system resources managed by each instance when those instances are no longer required p see PrinterData see PrintDialog

Starts a print job and returns true if the job started successfully and false otherwise p This must be the first method called to initiate a print job followed by any number of startPage endPage calls followed by endJob Calling startPage endPage or endJob before startJob will result in undefined behavior p param jobName the name of the print job to start return true if the job started successfully and false otherwise exception SWTException ul li ERROR DEVICE DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul see startPage see endPage see endJob

Given a desired em client area em for the receiver as described by the arguments returns the bounding rectangle which would be required to produce that client area p In other words it returns a rectangle such that if the receiver s bounds were set to that rectangle the area of the receiver which is capable of displaying data that is not covered by the trimmings would be the rectangle described by the arguments relative to the receiver s parent p Note that there is no setBounds for a printer This method is usually used by passing in the client area the printable area of the printer It can also be useful to pass in 0 0 0 0 param x the desired x coordinate of the client area param y the desired y coordinate of the client area param width the desired width of the client area param height the desired height of the client area return the required bounds to produce the given client area exception SWTException ul li ERROR DEVICE DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul see getBounds see getClientArea
