Instances of this class represent patterns to use while drawing Patterns can be specified either as bitmaps or gradients p Application code must explicitly invoke the code Pattern dispose code method to release the operating system resources managed by each instance when those instances are no longer required p since 3 1
the OS resource for the Pattern Warning This field is platform dependent p b IMPORTANT b This field is em not em part of the SWT public API It is marked public only so that it can be shared within the packages provided by SWT It is not available on all platforms and should never be accessed from application code p
Constructs a new Pattern given an image Drawing with the resulting pattern will cause the image to be tiled over the resulting area param device the device on which to allocate the pattern param image the image that the pattern will draw exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the device is null and there is no current device or the image is null li li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if the image has been disposed li ul exception SWTError ul li ERROR NO HANDLES if a handle for the pattern could not be obtained li ul see dispose
TODO how about alpha
Constructs a new Pattern that represents a linear two color gradient Drawing with the pattern will cause the resulting area to be tiled with the gradient specified by the arguments param device the device on which to allocate the pattern param x1 the x coordinate of the starting corner of the gradient param y1 the y coordinate of the starting corner of the gradient param x2 the x coordinate of the ending corner of the gradient param y2 the y coordinate of the ending corner of the gradient param color1 the starting color of the gradient param color2 the ending color of the gradient exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the device is null and there is no current device or if either color1 or color2 is null li li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if either color1 or color2 has been disposed li ul exception SWTError ul li ERROR NO HANDLES if a handle for the pattern could not be obtained li ul see dispose
Disposes of the operating system resources associated with the Pattern Applications must dispose of all Patterns that they allocate
Returns code true code if the Pattern has been disposed and code false code otherwise p This method gets the dispose state for the Pattern When a Pattern has been disposed it is an error to invoke any other method using the Pattern return code true code when the Pattern is disposed and code false code otherwise
Returns a string containing a concise human readable description of the receiver return a string representation of the receiver
