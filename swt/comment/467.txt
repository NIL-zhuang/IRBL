Instances of this class provide synchronization support for displays A default instance is created automatically for each display and this instance is sufficient for almost all applications p b IMPORTANT b Typical application code em never em needs to deal with this class It is provided only to allow applications which require non standard synchronization behavior to plug in the support they require em Subclasses which override the methods in this class must ensure that the superclass methods are invoked in their implementations em p see Display setSynchronizer
