Note Internet Explorer appears to treat the data loaded with nsIPersistStreamInit Load as if it were encoded using the default local charset There does not seem to be an API to set the desired charset explicitely in this case The fix is to prepend the UTF 8 Byte Order Mark signature to the data

If the html field is non null then the about blank page is already being loaded so no Stop or Navigate is required ust set the html that is to be shown
Navigate to the blank page and insert the given html when receiving the next DocumentComplete notification See the MSDN article Loading HTML content from a Stream Note Stop any pending request This is required to avoid displaying a blank page as a result of consecutive calls to setUrl and or setText The previous request would otherwise render the new html content and reset the html field before the browser actually navigates to the blank page as requested below Feature in Internet Explorer Stopping pending requests when no request is pending causes a default page Action cancelled to be displayed The workaround is to not invoke stop when no request has been set since that instance was created

Bug in Internet Explorer For some reason Navigating to an xml document before a previous Navigate has completed will leave the Browser in a bad state if the Navigate to the xml document does not complete This bad state causes a GP when the parent window is eventually disposed The workaround is to issue a Stop before navigating to any xml document
