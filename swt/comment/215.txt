Decode the input
Decode the LZW encoded bytes in the given byte stream into the given DeviceIndependentImage
Last byte has data
Nothing in last byte
Write out last partial block
Write out empty block to indicate the end if needed
Encode the image
Encode the bytes into the given byte stream from the given DeviceIndependentImage
Off by one
Encoding loop broken out to allow early return
Initialize the receiver for decoding the given byte array
Force a read
Initialize the receiver for encoding the given byte array
Answer the next code from the input byte array
Answer the next pixel to encode in the image
Copy a row of pixel values from the image
high order bits of the code
The whole code fit in the first byte so we are done
for the next one
Fill in any remaining whole bytes i e not the last one
Fill the low order bits of the last byte with the remainder
Output aCode to the output stream
Slight optimization for depth 8
Copy a row of pixel values to the image
Copy duplicate rows of pixel values to the image This is to fill in rows if the image is interlaced
Read a block from the byte stream Return the number of bytes read Throw an exception if the block could not be read
Write a block to the byte stream Throw an exception if the block could not be written
