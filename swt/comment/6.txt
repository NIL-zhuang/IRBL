This adapter class provides default implementations for the methods described by the code AccessibleControlListener code interface p Classes that wish to deal with code AccessibleControlEvent code s can extend this class and override only the methods that they are interested in p p Note Accessibility clients use child identifiers to specify whether they want information about a control or one of its children Child identifiers are increasing integers beginning with 0 The identifier CHILDID SELF represents the control itself When returning a child identifier to a client you may use CHILDID NONE to indicate that no child or control has the required information p p Note This adapter is typically used by implementors of a custom control to provide very detailed information about the control instance to accessibility clients p see AccessibleControlListener see AccessibleControlEvent since 2 0
Sent when an accessibility client requests the identifier of the control child at the specified display coordinates The default behavior is to do nothing p Return the identifier of the child at display point x y in the code childID code field of the event object Return CHILDID SELF if point x y is in the control itself and not in any child Return CHILDID NONE if point x y is not contained in either the control or any of its children p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li x y IN the specified point in display coordinates li li childID Typical OUT the ID of the child at point or CHILDID SELF or CHILDID NONE li li accessible Optional OUT the accessible object for the control or child may be returned instead of the childID li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the location of the control or the location of a child of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Return a rectangle describing the location of the specified control or child in the code x y width and height code fields of the event object p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID IN an identifier specifying the control or one of its children li li x y width height OUT the control or child location in display coordinates li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the accessible object for a child of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Return an code Accessible code for the specified control or child in the code accessible code field of the event object Return null if the specified child does not have its own code Accessible code p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID IN an identifier specifying a child of the control li li accessible OUT an Accessible for the specified childID or null if one does not exist li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the number of children in the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Return the number of child items in the code detail code field of the event object p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li detail OUT the number of child items in this control li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the default action of the control or the default action of a child of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p This string is typically a verb describing what the user does to it For example a Push Button s default action is Press a Check Button s is Check or UnCheck and List items have the default action Double Click p p Return a string describing the default action of the specified control or child in the code result code field of the event object Returning null tells the client to use the platform default action string p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID IN an identifier specifying the control or one of its children li li result OUT the requested default action string or null li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the identity of the child or control that has keyboard focus The default behavior is to do nothing p Return the identifier of the child that has focus in the code childID code field of the event object Return CHILDID SELF if the control itself has keyboard focus Return CHILDID NONE if neither the control nor any of its children has focus p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID Typical OUT the ID of the child with focus or CHILDID SELF or CHILDID NONE li li accessible Optional OUT the accessible object for a child may be returned instead of its childID li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the role of the control or the role of a child of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Return a role constant constant defined in ACC beginning with ROLE that describes the role of the specified control or child in the code detail code field of the event object p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID IN an identifier specifying the control or one of its children li li detail OUT a role constant describing the role of the control or child li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the identity of the child or control that is currently selected The default behavior is to do nothing p Return the identifier of the selected child in the code childID code field of the event object Return CHILDID SELF if the control itself is selected Return CHILDID MULTIPLE if multiple children are selected and return an array of childIDs in the code children code field Return CHILDID NONE if neither the control nor any of its children are selected p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID Typical OUT the ID of the selected child or CHILDID SELF or CHILDID MULTIPLE or CHILDID NONE li li accessible Optional OUT the accessible object for the control or child may be returned instead of the childID li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the state of the control or the state of a child of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Return a state constant constant defined in ACC beginning with STATE that describes the current state of the specified control or child in the code detail code field of the event object p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID IN an identifier specifying the control or one of its children li li detail OUT a state constant describing the current state of the control or child li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the value of the control or the value of a child of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Many controls do not return a value Examples of controls that do are Combo returns the text string Text returns its contents ProgressBar returns a string representing a percentage and Tree items return a string representing their level in the tree p p Return a string describing the value of the specified control or child in the code result code field of the event object Returning null tells the client to use the platform value string p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li childID IN an identifier specifying the control or one of its children li li result OUT the requested value string or null li ul
Sent when an accessibility client requests the children of the control The default behavior is to do nothing p Return the children as an array of childIDs in the code children code field of the event object p param e an event object containing the following fields ul li children Typical OUT an array of childIDs li li accessible Optional OUT an array of accessible objects for the children may be returned instead of the childIDs li ul
