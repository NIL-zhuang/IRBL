If this is a palette based device Decrease the reference count for this color If the reference count reaches 0 the slot may be reused when another color is allocated
Disposes of the operating system resources associated with the color Applications must dispose of all colors which they allocate
Compares the argument to the receiver and returns true if they represent the em same em object using a class specific comparison param object the object to compare with this object return code true code if the object is the same as this object and code false code otherwise see hashCode
Returns the amount of blue in the color from 0 to 255 return the blue component of the color exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul
Returns the amount of green in the color from 0 to 255 return the green component of the color exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul
Returns the amount of red in the color from 0 to 255 return the red component of the color exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul
Returns an code RGB code representing the receiver return the RGB for the color exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul
Returns an integer hash code for the receiver Any two objects that return code true code when passed to code equals code must return the same value for this method return the receiver s hash see equals
If this is not a palette based device return
First find out if the color already exists
See if the nearest color actually is the color
Found the color Increment the ref count and return
Didn t find the color allocate it now Find the first free entry
Found a free entry
Remake the handle from the actual rgbs
Allocates the operating system resources associated with the receiver param device the device on which to allocate the color param red the amount of red in the color param green the amount of green in the color param blue the amount of blue in the color exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if the red green or blue argument is not between 0 and 255 li ul see dispose
Returns code true code if the color has been disposed and code false code otherwise p This method gets the dispose state for the color When a color has been disposed it is an error to invoke any other method using the color return code true code when the color is disposed and code false code otherwise
