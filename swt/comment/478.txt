Feature in Windows When the user clicks on the tray icon another application may be the foreground window This means that the event loop is not running and can cause problems For example if a menu is shown when the user clicks outside of the menu to cancel it the menu is not hidden until an event is processed If another application is the foreground window then the menu is not hidden The fix is to force the tray icon message window to the foreground when sending an event
widget could be disposed at this point
