Make the parent shell be temporary modal
Bug in Windows On some hardware configurations SHBrowseForFolder causes warning dialogs with the message There is no disk in the drive Please insert a disk into Device Harddisk0 DR0 This is possibly caused by SHBrowseForFolder calling internally GetVolumeInformation MSDN for GetVolumeInformation says If you are attempting to obtain information about a floppy drive that does not have a floppy disk or a CD ROM drive that does not have a compact disc the system displays a message box asking the user to insert a floppy disk or a compact disc respectively To prevent the system from displaying this message box call the SetErrorMode function with SEM FAILCRITICALERRORS The fix is to save and restore the error mode using SetErrorMode with the SEM FAILCRITICALERRORS flag around SHBrowseForFolder
Bug in Windows When a WH MSGFILTER hook is used to run code during the message loop for SHBrowseForFolder running code in the hook can cause a GP Specifically SetWindowText for static controls seemed to make the problem happen The fix is to ignore the hook while the directory dialog is open NOTE This only happens in versions of the comctl32 dll earlier than 6 0
