Returns the path of the first file that was selected in the dialog relative to the filter path or an empty string if no such file has been selected return the relative path of the file
Returns a possibly empty array with the paths of all files that were selected in the dialog relative to the filter path return the relative paths of the files
Returns the file extensions which the dialog will use to filter the files it shows return the file extensions filter
Returns the names that describe the filter extensions which the dialog will use to filter the files it shows return the list of filter names
Returns the directory path that the dialog will use or an empty string if this is not set File names in this path will appear in the dialog filtered according to the filter extensions return the directory path string see setFilterExtensions
Get the owner HWND for the dialog
Convert the title and copy it into lpstrTitle
Use the character encoding for the default locale
Compute filters and copy into lpstrFilter
Use the character encoding for the default locale
Convert the fileName and filterName to C strings
Use the character encoding for the default locale
Copy the name into lpstrFile and ensure that the last byte is NULL and the buffer does not overrun
Copy the path into lpstrInitialDir and ensure that the last byte is NULL and the buffer does not overrun
Use the character encoding for the default locale
Create the file dialog struct
Set the default extension to an empty string If the user fails to type an extension and this extension is empty Windows uses the current value of the filter extension at the time that the dialog is closed
Make the parent shell be temporary modal
Open the dialog If the open fails due to an invalid file name use an empty file name and open it again
Clear the temporary dialog modal parent
Set the new path file name and filter
Use the character encoding for the default locale
Bug in WinCE For some reason nFileOffset and nFileExtension are always zero on WinCE HPC nFileOffset is always zero on WinCE PPC when using GetSaveFileName nFileOffset is correctly set on WinCE PPC when using OpenFileName The fix is to parse lpstrFile to calculate nFileOffset Note WinCE does not support multi select file dialogs
Use the character encoding for the default locale
Get each file from the buffer Files are delimited by a NULL character with 2 NULL characters at the end
Free the memory that was allocated
Answer the full path or null
Makes the dialog visible and brings it to the front of the display return a string describing the absolute path of the first selected file or null if the dialog was cancelled or an error occurred exception SWTException ul li ERROR WIDGET DISPOSED if the dialog has been disposed li li ERROR THREAD INVALID ACCESS if not called from the thread that created the dialog li ul
Set the initial filename which the dialog will select by default when opened to the argument which may be null The name will be prefixed with the filter path when one is supplied param string the file name
Set the file extensions which the dialog will use to filter the files it shows to the argument which may be null p The strings are platform specific For example on Windows an extension filter string is typically of the form extension where matches all files p param extensions the file extension filter
Sets the the names that describe the filter extensions which the dialog will use to filter the files it shows to the argument which may be null param names the list of filter names
Sets the directory path that the dialog will use to the argument which may be null File names in this path will appear in the dialog filtered according to the filter extensions If the string is null then the operating system s default filter path will be used p Note that the path string is platform dependent For convenience either or can be used as a path separator p param string the directory path see setFilterExtensions
