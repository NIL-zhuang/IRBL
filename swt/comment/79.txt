Root items are visible immediately
Feature in the Table The table uses the first image that is inserted into the table to size the table rows If the user is allowed to insert the first image this will cause the images to be scaled The fix is to insert a dummy image to force the size
Now that item has a sub node it must indicate that it can be expanded
Put the item in the items list

this is a root and can not be toggled between visible and hidden
remove row from table
parentItem must already be visible
create underlying table item and set data in table item to stored data
ignore any images in the first column
display the children and the appropriate symbol as required
