Bug in Windows When LVM SETCOLUMNWIDTH is used with LVSCW AUTOSIZE where each item has I IMAGECALLBACK but there are no images in the table the size computed by LVM SETCOLUMNWIDTH is too small for the first column causing long items to be clipped with The fix is to increase the column width by a small amount
Bug in Windows When LVM SETCOLUMNWIDTH is used with LVSCW AUTOSIZE for a table with a state image list the column is width does not include space for the state icon The fix is to increase the column width by the width of the image list
Feature in Windows When LVSCW AUTOSIZE USEHEADER is used with LVM SETCOLUMNWIDTH to resize the last column the last column is expanded to fill the client area The fix is to resize the table to be small set the column width and then restore the table to its original size

Bug in Windows For some reason when the title of a column is changed after the column has been created the alignment must also be reset or the text does not draw The fix is to query and then set the alignment
Bug in Windows When a column header contains a mnemonic character Windows does not measure the text properly This causes to always appear at the end of the text The fix is to remove mnemonic characters and replace doubled mnemonics with spaces
