Releases the receiver a child in a widget hierarchy from its parent p When a widget is destroyed it may be necessary to remove it from an internal data structure of the parent When a widget has no handle it may also be necessary for the parent to hide the widget or otherwise indicate that the widget has been disposed For example disposing a menu bar requires that the menu bar first be released from the shell when the menu bar is active This could not be done in code destroyWidget code for the menu bar because the parent shell as well as other fields have been null d out already by code releaseWidget code p This method is called first when a widget is disposed see dispose see releaseChild see releaseWidget see releaseHandle
Releases the widget s handle by zero ing it out Does not destroy or release any operating system resources p This method is called after code releaseWidget code or from code destroyWidget code when a widget is being destroyed to ensure that the widget is marked as destroyed in case the act of destroying the widget in the operating system causes application code to run in callback that could access the widget p see dispose see releaseChild see releaseWidget see releaseHandle
Releases any internal resources back to the operating system and clears all fields except the widget handle p When a widget is destroyed resources that were acquired on behalf of the programmer need to be returned to the operating system For example if the widget made a copy of an icon supplied by the programmer this copy would be freed in code releaseWidget code Also to assist the garbage collector and minimize the amount of memory that is not reclaimed when the programmer keeps a reference to a disposed widget all fields except the handle are zero d The handle is needed by code destroyWidget code p p Typically a widget with children will broadcast this message to all children so that they too can release their resources The code releaseHandle code method is used as part of this broadcast to zero the handle fields of the children without calling code destroyWidget code In this scenario the children are actually destroyed later when the operating system destroys the widget tree p This method is called after code releaseChild code see dispose see releaseChild see releaseWidget see releaseHandle

Feature in Windows When the user presses Ctrl Backspace or Ctrl Enter Windows sends a WM CHAR with Delete 0x7F and n instead of b and r This is the correct platform behavior but is not portable The fix is to detect these cases and convert the character
Feature in Windows When the user presses either the Enter key or the numeric keypad Enter key Windows sends a WM KEYDOWN with wParam VK RETURN in both cases In order to distinguish between the keys the extended key bit is tested If the bit is set assume that the numeric keypad Enter was pressed
Feature in Windows The virtual key VK DELETE is not treated as both a virtual key and an ASCII key by Windows Therefore we will not receive a WM CHAR for this key The fix is to treat VK DELETE as a special case and map the ASCII value explictly Delete is 0x7F
Feature in Windows When the user presses Ctrl Pause the VK CANCEL key is generated and a WM CHAR is sent with 0x03 possibly to allow an application to look for Ctrl C and the the Break key at the same time This is unexpected and unwanted The fix is to detect the case and set the character to zero
Feature in Windows On Windows CE SetWindowPos when called with SWP DRAWFRAME always causes a WM SIZE message even when SWP NOSIZE is set and when the new size is the same as the old size The fix is to clear SWP DRAWFRAME when the size is the same

Feature in Windows SHRecognizeGesture sends an undocumented WM CONTEXTMENU notification when the flag SHRG NOTIFY PARENT is not set This causes the context menu to be displayed twice once by the caller of SHRecognizeGesture and once from this method The fix is to ignore WM CONTEXTMENU notifications on all WinCE platforms NOTE This only happens on WM2003 Previous WinCE versions did not support WM CONTEXTMENU
Feature in Windows When the user presses WM NCRBUTTONUP a WM CONTEXTMENU message is generated This happens when the user releases the mouse over a scroll bar Normally window displays the default scrolling menu but applications can process WM CONTEXTMENU to display a different menu Typically an application does not want to supply a special scroll menu The fix is to look for a WM CONTEXTMENU that originated from a mouse event and display the menu when the mouse was released in the client area

Ignore repeating modifier keys by testing key down state
Clear last key and last ascii because a new key has been typed
Do not report a lead byte as a key pressed
Bug in WinCE MapVirtualKey returns incorrect values The fix is to rely on a key mappings table to determine whether the key event must be sent now or if a WM CHAR event will follow The key mappings table maps virtual keys to SWT key codes and does not contain mappings for Windows virtual keys like VK A Virtual keys that are both virtual and ASCII are a special case
Bug in Windows 95 and NT When the user types an accent key such as to get an accented character on a German keyboard the accent key should be ignored and the next key that the user types is the accented key The fix is to detect the accent key stroke called a dead key by testing the high bit of the value returned by MapVirtualKey A further problem is that the high bit on Windows NT is bit 32 while the high bit on Windows 95 is bit 16 They should both be bit 32 When the user types an accent key that does not correspond to a virtual key MapVirtualKey won t set the high bit to indicate a dead key This happens when an accent key such as is the result of a modifier such as Shift key and MapVirtualKey always returns the unshifted key The fix is to peek for a WM DEADCHAR and avoid issuing the event
Bug in Windows Somehow the widget is becoming disposed after calling PeekMessage In rare cirucmstances it seems that PeekMessage can allow SWT listeners to run that might contain application code that disposes the widget It is not exactly clear how this can happen PeekMessage is only looking for WM DEADCHAR It is not dispatching any message that it finds or removing any message from the queue Cross thread messages are disabled The fix is to check for a disposed widget and return without calling the window proc
If we are going to get a WM CHAR ensure that last key has the correct character value for the key down and key up events It is not sufficient to ignore the WM KEYDOWN when we know we are going to get a WM CHAR and compute the key in WM CHAR because there is not enough information by the time we get the WM CHAR For example when the user types Ctrl Shift 6 on a US keyboard we get a WM CHAR with wParam 30 When the user types Ctrl Shift 6 on a German keyboard we also get a WM CHAR with wParam 30 On the US keyboard Shift 6 is on the German keyboard Shift 6 is There is no way to map wParam 30 in WM CHAR to the correct value Also on international keyboards the control key may be down when the user has not entered a control character NOTE On Windows 98 keypad keys are virtual despite the fact that a WM CHAR is issued On Windows 2000 and XP they are not virtual Therefore it is necessary to force numeric keypad keys to be virtual
Convert LastKey to lower case because Windows non virtual keys that are also ASCII keys such as like VK A are have upper case values in WM KEYDOWN despite the fact that the Shift was not pressed
Feature in Windows The virtual key VK CANCEL is treated as both a virtual key and ASCII key by Windows This means that a WM CHAR with WPARAM 3 will be issued for this key In order to distinguish between this key and Ctrl C mark the key as virtual
Some key combinations map to Windows ASCII keys depending on the keyboard For example Ctrl Alt Q maps to on a German keyboard If the current key combination is special the correct character is placed in wParam for processing in WM CHAR If this is the case issue the key down event from inside WM CHAR
When the user types Ctrl Space ToAscii maps this to Space Normally ToAscii maps a key to a different key if both a WM KEYDOWN and a WM CHAR will be issued To avoid the extra SWT KeyDown look for a space and issue the event from WM CHAR
Feature in Windows The virtual key VK CANCEL is treated as both a virtual key and ASCII key by Windows This means that a WM CHAR with WPARAM 3 will be issued for this key To avoid the extra SWT KeyDown look for VK CANCEL and issue the event from WM CHAR
If the control key is not down at this point then the key that was pressed was an accent key or a regular key such as A or Shift A In that case issue the key event from WM CHAR
Get the shifted state or convert to lower case if necessary If the user types Ctrl A LastAscii should be a not A If the user types Ctrl Shift A LastAscii should be A If the user types Ctrl Shift 6 the value of LastAscii will depend on the international keyboard
Note that Ctrl is ASCII NUL and is delivered in WM CHAR
Feature in Windows The virtual key VK DELETE is not treated as both a virtual key and an ASCII key by Windows Therefore we will not receive a WM CHAR for this key The fix is to treat VK DELETE as a special case and map the ASCII value explictly Delete is 0x7F
Feature in Windows Calling to ToAscii or ToUnicode clears the accented state such that the next WM CHAR loses the accent This makes is critical that the accent key is detected Also these functions clear the character that is entered using the special Windows keypad sequence when NumLock is down ie typing ALT 0231 should gives c with a cedilla when NumLock is down
It is possible to get a WM CHAR for a virtual key when Num Lock is on If the user types Home while Num Lock is down a WM CHAR is issued with WPARM 55 for the character 7 If we are going to get a WM CHAR we need to ensure that the last key has the correct value Note that Ctrl Home does not issue a WM CHAR when Num Lock is down

It is possible but unlikely that application code could have disposed the widget in the focus or deactivate events If this happens end the processing of the Windows message by returning zero as the result of the window proc
Feature in Windows Windows sends the following messages when the user double clicks the mouse WM LBUTTONDOWN mouse down WM LBUTTONUP mouse up WM LBUTTONDBLCLK double click WM LBUTTONUP mouse up Applications that expect matching mouse down up pairs will not see the second mouse down The fix is to send a mouse down event
Feature in Windows It s possible that the drag operation will not be started while the mouse is down meaning that the mouse should be captured This can happen when the user types the ESC key to cancel the drag The fix is to query the state of the mouse and capture the mouse accordingly
Note On WinCE PPC only attempt to recognize the gesture for a context menu when the control contains a valid menu or there are listeners for the MenuDetect event
Feature in Windows DragDetect captures the mouse and tracks its movement until the user releases the left mouse button presses the ESC key or moves the mouse outside the drag rectangle If the user moves the mouse outside of the drag rectangle DragDetect returns true and a drag and drop operation can be started When the left mouse button is released or the ESC key is pressed these events are consumed by DragDetect so that application code that matches mouse down up pairs or looks for the ESC key will not function properly The fix is to send the missing events when the drag has not started NOTE For now don t send a fake WM KEYDOWN WM KEYUP events for the ESC key This would require computing wParam the key and lParam the repeat count scan code extended key flag context code previous key state flag and transition state flag which is non trivial
Feature in Windows Windows sends the following messages when the user double clicks the mouse WM MBUTTONDOWN mouse down WM MBUTTONUP mouse up WM MLBUTTONDBLCLK double click WM MBUTTONUP mouse up Applications that expect matching mouse down up pairs will not see the second mouse down The fix is to send a mouse down event
