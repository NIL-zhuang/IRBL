Instances of this class lay out the control children of a code Composite code in a grid p code GridLayout code has a number of configuration fields and the controls it lays out can have an associated layout data object called code GridData code The power of code GridLayout code lies in the ability to configure code GridData code for each control in the layout p p The following code creates a shell managed by a code GridLayout code with 3 columns pre Display display new Display Shell shell new Shell display GridLayout gridLayout new GridLayout gridLayout numColumns 3 shell setLayout gridLayout pre The code numColumns code field is the most important field in a code GridLayout code Widgets are laid out in columns from left to right and a new row is created when code numColumns code 1 controls are added to the code Composite code p see GridData
numColumns specifies the number of cell columns in the layout The default value is 1
makeColumnsEqualWidth specifies whether all columns in the layout will be forced to have the same width The default value is false
marginWidth specifies the number of pixels of horizontal margin that will be placed along the left and right edges of the layout The default value is 5
marginHeight specifies the number of pixels of vertical margin that will be placed along the top and bottom edges of the layout The default value is 5
marginLeft specifies the number of pixels of horizontal margin that will be placed along the left edge of the layout The default value is 0 since 3 1
marginTop specifies the number of pixels of vertical margin that will be placed along the top edge of the layout The default value is 0 since 3 1
marginRight specifies the number of pixels of horizontal margin that will be placed along the right edge of the layout The default value is 0 since 3 1
marginBottom specifies the number of pixels of vertical margin that will be placed along the bottom edge of the layout The default value is 0 since 3 1
horizontalSpacing specifies the number of pixels between the right edge of one cell and the left edge of its neighbouring cell to the right The default value is 5
verticalSpacing specifies the number of pixels between the bottom edge of one cell and the top edge of its neighbouring cell underneath The default value is 5
Constructs a new instance of this class
Constructs a new instance of this class given the number of columns and whether or not the columns should be forced to have the same width param numColumns the number of columns in the grid param makeColumnsEqualWidth whether or not the columns will have equal width since 2 0
