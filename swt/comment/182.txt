Instances of this class represent transformation matrices for points expressed as x y pairs of floating point numbers p Application code must explicitly invoke the code Transform dispose code method to release the operating system resources managed by each instance when those instances are no longer required p since 3 1
the OS resource for the Transform Warning This field is platform dependent p b IMPORTANT b This field is em not em part of the SWT public API It is marked public only so that it can be shared within the packages provided by SWT It is not available on all platforms and should never be accessed from application code p

Disposes of the operating system resources associated with the Transform Applications must dispose of all Transforms that they allocate
Fills the parameter with the values of the transformation matrix that the receiver represents in the order m11 m12 m21 m22 dx dy param elements array to hold the matrix values return in elements array the transformation matrix represented by the receiver exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the parameter is null li li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if the parameter is too small to hold the matrix values li ul
Modifies the receiver such that the matrix it represents becomes the the mathematical inverse of the matrix it previously represented exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li li ERROR CANNOT INVERT MATRIX if the matrix is not invertable li ul
Returns code true code if the Transform has been disposed and code false code otherwise p This method gets the dispose state for the Transform When a Transform has been disposed it is an error to invoke any other method using the Transform return code true code when the Transform is disposed and code false code otherwise
Returns code true code if the Transform represents the identity matrix and false otherwise return code true code if the receiver is an identity Transform and code false code otherwise
Modifies the receiver such that the matrix it represents becomes the the result of multiplying the matrix it previously represented by the argument param matrix the matrix to multiply the receiver by exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul exception IllegalArgumentException ul li ERROR NULL ARGUMENT if the parameter is null li li ERROR INVALID ARGUMENT if the parameter has been disposed li ul
Modifies the receiver so that it represents a transformation that is equivalent to its previous transformation rotated by the specified angle The angle is specified in degrees and for the identity transform 0 degrees is at the 3 o clock position A positive value indicates a clockwise rotation while a negative value indicates a counter clockwise rotation param angle the angle to rotate the transformation by exception SWTException ul li ERROR GRAPHIC DISPOSED if the receiver has been disposed li ul
