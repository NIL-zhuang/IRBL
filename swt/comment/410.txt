Instances of this class determine the size and position of the children of a code Composite code by placing them either in horizontal rows or vertical columns within the parent code Composite code p code RowLayout code aligns all controls in one row if the code type code is set to horizontal and one column if it is set to vertical It has the ability to wrap and provides configurable margins and spacing code RowLayout code has a number of configuration fields In addition the height and width of each control in a code RowLayout code can be specified by setting a code RowData code object into the control using code setLayoutData code p p The following example code creates a code RowLayout code sets all of its fields to non default values and then sets it into a code Shell code pre RowLayout rowLayout new RowLayout rowLayout wrap false rowLayout pack false rowLayout justify true rowLayout type SWT VERTICAL rowLayout marginLeft 5 rowLayout marginTop 5 rowLayout marginRight 5 rowLayout marginBottom 5 rowLayout spacing 0 shell setLayout rowLayout pre If you are using the default field values you only need one line of code pre shell setLayout new RowLayout pre p see RowData
type specifies whether the layout places controls in rows or columns The default value is HORIZONTAL Possible values are ul li HORIZONTAL Position the controls horizontally from left to right li li VERTICAL Position the controls vertically from top to bottom li ul since 2 0
marginWidth specifies the number of pixels of horizontal margin that will be placed along the left and right edges of the layout The default value is 0 since 3 0
marginHeight specifies the number of pixels of vertical margin that will be placed along the top and bottom edges of the layout The default value is 0 since 3 0
spacing specifies the number of pixels between the edge of one cell and the edge of its neighbouring cell The default value is 3
wrap specifies whether a control will be wrapped to the next row if there is insufficient space on the current row The default value is true
pack specifies whether all controls in the layout take their preferred size If pack is false all controls will have the same size which is the size required to accommodate the largest preferred height and the largest preferred width of all the controls in the layout The default value is true
fill specifies whether the controls in a row should be all the same height for horizontal layouts or the same width for vertical layouts The default value is false since 3 0
justify specifies whether the controls in a row should be fully justified with any extra space placed between the controls The default value is false
marginLeft specifies the number of pixels of horizontal margin that will be placed along the left edge of the layout The default value is 3
marginTop specifies the number of pixels of vertical margin that will be placed along the top edge of the layout The default value is 3
marginRight specifies the number of pixels of horizontal margin that will be placed along the right edge of the layout The default value is 3
marginBottom specifies the number of pixels of vertical margin that will be placed along the bottom edge of the layout The default value is 3
Constructs a new instance of this class
Constructs a new instance of this class given the type param type the type of row layout since 2 0
